# SERVES
SERVES (Soil-moisture Estimation of Root-zone through Vegetation-index based Evapotranspiration-fraction and Soil-properties) is based on Pradhan (2019).
This repository has the SERVES executable setup package.

RUNNING SERVES MODEL
1) Run setup.exe in the folder SERVES_SETUP
2) copy the executable named SERVES.exe from where the program is setup and paste it in the folder where the input files (mentioned above) are located. 
usually the path where SERVES.exe is located is something like this:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Default Company Name\Setup1 
3) to run the program, open dos command prompt and go to the location where the exe and input files exist. Type the following command and press enter key:
SERVES.exe filename.prj
where, ‘SERVES.exe’ is the SERVES model executable and ‘filename.prj’ is the project file name as mentioned in section ‘PROJECT FILE
